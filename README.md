#Tomcat Configurations
1. Go to conf/server.xml 
2. Go to line where it says and uncomment it out where it reads [port="8443"]

##How to run
1. cd single-sign-on
2. mvn clean install
3. copy cas.war, customer.war and bank.war to tomcat webapps folder
4. Start the tomcat
5. Access customer website : <a href="http://localhost:8080/customer/">Customer</a>
	This should redirect you to CAS login screen. Once your credentials are entered, you will redirect to customer website. To see the list of user look at [single-sign-on/cas/src/main/resources/database/users.sql]
6. Now access the second bank website <a href="http://localhost:8080/bank/">Bank</a> which should be authenticated previously will be redirected to bank website.
